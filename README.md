# Mixed Messages CodeAcademy Project
### Created by @MikeParka :rocket:

Mixed Messages is a CodeAcademy Project with the objective of creating a randomised message every time the script is run.

The topic I selected was recipes. There are three sets of ingredients, and the script will pick a random one from each set. Finally, a randomised recipe will be returned.

*Satisfaction is not guaranteed.*

### My goals for this exercise were as follows:
* Use VS Code to write the JavaScript code
* Use Node to execute the script locally
* Use Git Bash for source control
* Write the README file using Markdown
* Post my solution in the CodeAcademy forum
